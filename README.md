If you wish to use this library, please import the CSS in your global entrypoint (_app.tsx or layout.tsx)
Example: react-datepicker will not have styles if you don't include "import 'react-datepicker/dist/react-datepicker.css';" in your global entrypoint.

## Example from MDA
Add this to package.json dependencies:
```
    "support-package": "file: PATH_TO_PROJECT"
```

and run `npm install`
